      "answer": "## Combined Shipping Weight and Warranty Analysis\n\n### **1. Combined Shipping Weight Calculation**\n\n**Items:**\n- **Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max**  \n  - **Weight:** 221 grams (Source 1)  \n- **Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 40**  \n  - **Weight:** 283 grams **per shoe** (Source 2)  \n\n**Assumption:** The Nike product is sold as a **pair** (2 shoes), as is standard for footwear.  \n\n**Calculation:**  \n```\nTotal weight = iPhone weight + (Nike shoe weight × 2)\n            = 221g + (283g × 2)\n            = 221g + 566g\n            = **787 grams**\n```\n\n**Final Result:** **787 grams (0.787 kg)**  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Bundled Warranty Analysis**\n\n**Vendor Context:**  \n- The Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 40 are **sold by separate vendors** (Apple Inc. and Nike Inc.).  \n- **No information** is provided in the context about a bundled warranty for these two products.  \n\n**Key Findings:**  \n- **Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max:**  \n  - No warranty details are included in the product summary or specifications (Source 1).  \n  - Typically, Apple provides a **1-year limited warranty**, but this is not confirmed in the given context.  \n\n- **Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 40:**  \n  - No warranty information is provided in the product summary or specifications (Source 2).  \n  - Nike’s standard warranty (e.g., 365-day warranty for manufacturing defects) is not explicitly mentioned here.  \n\n- **Vendor Bundling:**  \n  - The context does not indicate that Apple or Nike offers a **bundled warranty** for purchasing these items together.  \n  - The third source (TechSupply Solutions) is unrelated to these products and does not provide relevant warranty information.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **No bundled warranty** is explicitly provided for purchasing both items together.  \n- Each product’s warranty would be governed by the **individual manufacturer’s terms** (Apple for the iPhone, Nike for the shoes).  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Summary Table**\n\n| **Item**                          | **Weight (g)** | **Warranty Status**                     |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max           | 221            | Not specified in context                |\n| Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 40 (pair)  | 566            | Not specified in context                |\n| **Combined Total**                | **787**        | **No bundled warranty** (vendors separate) |\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recommendations**  \n- **Shipping Weight:** Confirm with the vendor if the Nike product is sold as a single shoe or a pair (though standard practice assumes a pair).  \n- **Warranty:** Contact Apple and Nike directly to verify warranty terms for each product.  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \n- **Combined shipping weight:** **787 grams (0.787 kg)**  \n- **Bundled warranty:** **No** — the vendor does not provide a bundled warranty for these items.",
