Lord Hanuman: A Comprehensive Life History, Genealogy, Titles, Deeds, Worship, and Legacy

Main takeaway: Lord Hanuman is revered as the epitome of devotion, strength, humility, and wisdom. Born to Anjana and Kesari with the divine agency of Vayu and the grace of Shiva, Hanuman’s life spans from miraculous childhood exploits to pivotal roles in the Ramayana, culminating in eternal service to Lord Rama. His genealogy, countless epithets, scriptural references, regional traditions, and living worship together form one of the richest devotional traditions in Hinduism.

Introduction
Lord Hanuman—also known as Anjaneya, Maruti, Bajrangbali, Pavansuta, and Sankat Mochan—is among the most beloved figures in Hindu tradition. He embodies bhakti (devotion), shakti (strength), buddhi (intelligence), and nishkama karma (selfless action). His story bridges puranic lore, the Itihasa of the Ramayana, and later devotional movements. This document presents a detailed, structured narrative from birth to his ongoing presence in the world, along with genealogical information, regional variations, names and titles, iconography, sacred texts, worship practices, and philosophical significance.

1) Birth, Parentage, and Genealogy
1.1 Parents and Divine Conception

- Mother: Anjana (also Anjani), a celestial apsara (often identified with Punjikastala) who was cursed to take birth on earth and return to the heavenly realms upon bearing a divine child. She performed intense tapas to Lord Shiva for a son of extraordinary valor and devotion.
- Father (earthly): Kesari, a valiant vanara chieftain (often associated with Sumeru/Trigarta/Vanara territories), renowned for courage and adherence to dharma.
- Spiritual/Divine Agency: Vayu (Pavana/Marut), the Wind God, carried Shiva’s grace/prasada (divya tejas) to Anjana, resulting in Hanuman’s conception. Thus, Hanuman is called Vayuputra, Pavansuta, and Maruti, and considered an amsha (aspect) of Lord Shiva.

1.2 Birthplace and Early Setting

- Common traditions place Hanuman’s birth in the Anjanadri region (e.g., Kishkindha traditions; Anjaneya hills) or associated with Hampi/Karnataka lore and other regional sites. Temples and local traditions preserve multiple sacred geographies for his birth.
- The day of his birth is celebrated as Hanuman Jayanti, whose date varies by region (Chaitra Purnima in North Indian tradition; Margazhi/Moola nakshatra observances in parts of South India; other local calendars also exist).

1.3 Family Names and Relations

- Mother: Anjana (Anjani)
- Father: Kesari
- Spiritual Father/Patron: Vayu (Pavana/Marut)
- Primary Lineage Epithets: Anjaneya/Anjaniputra/Anjanasuta; Kesarinandan/Kesarisuta; Vayuputra/Pavansuta/Maruti
- Brothers (as preserved in certain puranic and regional recensions): Matiman, Shrutiman, Ketuman, Gatiman, Dhritiman (nomenclature may vary by source; these are not universally cited in all Ramayana recensions).
- Son: Makardhwaja (Makaradhvaja), born miraculously when a drop of Hanuman’s perspiration entered the ocean and was swallowed by a Makara (great fish/crocodile). Many traditions place his upbringing in Patalaloka under Ahiravana/Mahiravana’s domain.
- Kinship with Bhima: In the Mahabharata, Bhima is also Vayu’s son (through Kunti), making Hanuman and Bhima spiritual brothers. Hanuman appears to Bhima and later adorns Arjuna’s banner as “Kapi-dhwaja.”

2) Childhood: Marvels, Mischief, and Boons
2.1 The Sun as a Fruit

- As a child with boundless energy, Hanuman leapt to seize the rising sun, mistaking it for a ripe fruit. Indra struck him with the Vajra; Hanuman fell and injured his jaw (hanu), which gave rise to the name “Hanuman.”
- Vayu, in grief and anger, withdrew the life-breath from the world, prompting the devas to bestow boons and heal the child.

2.2 Boons and Divine Gifts

- From Brahma: Freedom of movement, protection against curses beyond due measure, and blessings of success in righteous endeavors.
- From Indra: The blow of the Vajra would not harm him thereafter; his body would be as resilient as the thunderbolt.
- From Agni: Immunity to fire.
- From Varuna: Protection against water (floods/drowning).
- From Vayu: Matchless speed, agility, and subtlety of movement.
- From Surya: Enlightenment and scriptural knowledge later in life (as Guru).
- From Vishwakarma and others: Various protections, strength, and skill sets. Collectively these boons endowed him with near-invulnerability, immense strength, the power of flight/leaping, and sharp intellect.

2.3 The Sage’s Admonition and “Forgotten Powers”

- In youthful mischief, Hanuman sometimes disturbed ascetics. A sage pronounced that Hanuman would forget his divine powers until reminded at the proper time. This motif explains why, during the Sita search, Jambavan’s exhortation rekindled Hanuman’s memory, unleashing his full might.

3) Preparation for Destiny: Education, Ethos, and Alliances
3.1 Disciple of Surya

- Hanuman sought Surya, the Sun God, as his Guru, learning grammar, scriptures, and the arts of speech, diplomacy, and ethics while keeping pace with Surya’s chariot. Surya, pleased, blessed Hanuman with eloquence and wisdom. Hanuman offered Guru Dakshina; Surya requested Hanuman assist his spiritual son Sugriva.

3.2 Meeting Rama and Lakshmana

- Hanuman encountered Rama and Lakshmana while they searched for Sita, disguised initially as a humble minister of Sugriva. Through refined speech and discernment, he recognized Rama’s divinity and pledged unwavering service. This meeting sealed Hanuman’s destiny as the foremost servant (dasya-bhakta) of Rama.

3.3 Sugriva’s Cause and Vali’s Defeat

- Hanuman facilitated the alliance between Rama and Sugriva. After proof of strength and loyalty, Rama aided Sugriva against Vali. Hanuman navigated diplomacy, intelligence-gathering, and logistics to unify the vanara forces for the forthcoming campaign.

4) The Search for Sita: Leaps, Trials, and Revelation
4.1 The Great Leap (Mahodadhi Langhana)

- At the shore, the vanaras hesitated before the ocean’s vastness. Jambavan reminded Hanuman of his true nature. Empowered, Hanuman expanded and leapt across hundreds of yojanas.
- Trials en route included:
    - Mainaka (the mountain) rising to offer rest; Hanuman honored him but refused pause, dedicated to his mission.
    - Surasa, a serpent-mother testing his wit; he outmaneuvered her by shrinking and expanding, passing through with respect and speed.
    - Simhika, a demoness who seized shadows; Hanuman destroyed her and continued.

4.2 Lanka Entry and Ashoka Vatika

- Hanuman entered Lanka subtly (kshudra rupa), surveyed defenses, and located Sita in the Ashoka grove (Ashoka Vatika) guarded by rakshasis. He offered Rama’s signet ring to assure her. Sita entrusted him with the Chudamani (jewel) as proof for Rama.

4.3 Hanuman’s Valor and Lanka Dahana

- To gauge enemy strength and sow fear, Hanuman allowed himself to be captured. His tail was set ablaze; using that very fire, Hanuman ignited parts of Lanka while sparing sanctuaries and Sita’s grove. This act announced Rama’s imminent power and resolve.

5) War in Lanka: Strategy, Service, and Miracle of Sanjeevani
5.1 Battlefield Roles

- Messenger, strategist, medic, and shock force—Hanuman’s roles were multifaceted. He neutralized threats, carried messages, and rescued allies in tight situations, embodying swift, precise service.

5.2 Sanjeevani Mission

Sent to Dronagiri (Gandhamadana) to fetch Sanjeevani, Hanuman, uncertain of the exact herb, lifted the entire mountain and transported it to the battlefield, enabling the healers to revive Lakshmana. This episode represents decisive action, humility, and life-saving ingenuity.

5.3 Final Phases and Victory

- Throughout the war, Hanuman shattered illusions and ambushes, countered sorceries, and protected Rama’s forces. With Ravana’s defeat, dharma was restored, and Sita’s honor vindicated.

6) Aftermath: Return to Ayodhya, Eternal Devotion, and Boons

- Blessed with chiranjivita (long-lived, near-immortal presence), Hanuman vowed to be wherever Rama’s name is sung. Traditions hold that Hanuman continues to protect devotees, saints, and pilgrim paths.

6.3 Role Beyond Ramayana
