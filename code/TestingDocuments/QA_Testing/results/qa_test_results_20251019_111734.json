      "answer": "## Combined Shipping Weight and Warranty Analysis\n\n### **1. Combined Shipping Weight Calculation**\n\n**Extracted Weights:**\n- **Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max**: 221 grams (Source 1)\n- **Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 40**: 283 grams **per shoe** (Source 2)\n\n**Interpretation:**\n- The Nike product specifies **283g per shoe**, but the query asks for the combined weight of \"both\" items. Since the Nike product is a **running shoe** (typically sold in pairs), the user is likely purchasing **one pair (2 shoes)**. However, the context explicitly states **\"per shoe\"**, and the query does **not** explicitly request a pair. \n\n**Assumption:**\n- **Literal interpretation**: Use the **per-shoe weight** (283g) as stated in the spec unless the query explicitly requests a pair.  \n- **If the user purchases a pair**: Multiply by 2 (283g × 2 = 566g).  \n\n**Calculation:**\n```\nTotal Weight = iPhone 15 Pro Max (221g) + Nike Pegasus 40 (283g per shoe)\n             = 221g + 283g\n             = **504 grams (0.504 kg)**\n```\n\n**Note**: If the user purchases a **pair of shoes**, the total weight would be **787 grams (221g + 566g)**. This is not explicitly requested in the query, so we proceed with the **literal per-shoe value**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Vendor Bundled Warranty Analysis**\n\n**Vendors and Warranty Information:**\n- **Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max**: Sold by **Apple Inc.** (Source 1). The warranty is likely covered under Apple's standard 1-year limited warranty.\n- **Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 40**: Sold by **Nike Inc.** (Source 2). The warranty is likely covered under Nike's standard product warranty.\n\n**Bundled Warranty Check:**\n- The context does **not mention** any bundled warranty for purchasing both items together.\n- The vendors (Apple and Nike) are **separate entities**, and there is **no indication** of a joint warranty or combined terms in the provided sources.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- **No bundled warranty** is provided for purchasing both items together. Each product’s warranty is governed by its respective manufacturer.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n- **Combined Shipping Weight**: **504 grams (0.504 kg)**  \n  *(Assumes one iPhone 15 Pro Max and one Nike shoe based on the \"per shoe\" specification.)*\n- **Bundled Warranty**: **Not provided**. Warranties are separate for Apple and Nike products.  \n\n**Key Assumptions:**\n- The Nike weight is interpreted as **per shoe** (283g), not for a pair.\n- No additional vendor information about bundled warranties is available in the context.",
